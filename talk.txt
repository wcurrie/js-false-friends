similarities
* 4 letters
* curly brackets
* semicolons

* new operator

differences
* static vs dynamic typing
* no class keyword (yet)

this
* motivating example
* 4 invocation patterns
 - method
 - function
 - constructor
 - apply (or call)
* why? allows code reuse: delegation via prototype chain


{}
* no block scope (without ES6 let statement)
* IIFE
* variables are global without 'var'
* hoisting

closures
* for loop to build a set of buttons

for in loop can return unwanted members

where are my classes?

== vs === 
* type coercion

only one thread
* show for loop locking up the UI?
